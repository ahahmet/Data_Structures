        |-----------------|      |-----------------|      |-----------------|
root--->|  Data  |  next  |----->|  Data  |  next  |----->|  Data  |  next  |--->NULL
root<---|  Data  |  prev  |<-----|  Data  |  prev  |<-----|  Data  |  prev  |
        |-----------------|      |-----------------|      |-----------------|



Linked list is a data structure and it helps to control or design the data on the RAM.
Linked list is exist the block and each block call the node. The root points the first node
and it must not the lost, always time must the keep. 

Each node includes the data and point (next-prev(optional)) section. Data section assist storage 
the data, point section is always time point the next or previous nodes.

If the linked list goes to forward (single way), you must put the null character the end of 
linked list. The null pointer make aware to us about where is end of the linked list.

If the linked list goes forward and backward (double way), you must put the null character 
the end of linked list and you must check the root when you move to back. The root make 
aware to us about the where is the begin of the linked list.


Why we must keep the root?
